# [PERSONAL PROJECT] [02] NodeJs Basics - fromcallback to promises.
Just console simple app.

## Concepts details.
### -> Callback
> A function who serves as argument to another function, the second one can call it.

| Advantages                        | Disadvantages                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple**, conceptually          | **Toscas**, when nesting many (Callback hell)           |
| **Universal**, they are JS native | **Little intuitive**, to understand the flow is tedious |

#### Notes
*Â· First callback argument allways will be the error.*
